This project thrives to integrate the [shotgun toolkit](https://toolkit.shotgunsoftware.com/home) with facilities of [bcore](https://github.com/Byron/bcore).

For that reason, whenever *tank* is supposed to be used, *btank* is used to initialize it. That way, monkey patches can be applied as necessary.
